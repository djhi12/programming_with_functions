Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

Ans. Functions proved their power during a semester project where I efficiently processed a large dataset by breaking down the task into modular functions, enabling easier debugging, maintenance, and code reuse for similar tasks.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Ans. Test functions are highly valuable as they ensure code correctness, catch bugs early, and act as a safety net during code evolution, contributing to improved code quality, maintainability, and developer confidence.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

Ans. When troubleshooting and fixing a problematic program, I first try to identify the specific issue by examining error messages, checking logs, and using debugging tools like print statements or IDE debuggers. If the problem remains elusive, I break down the program into smaller parts and test each component separately to pinpoint the problematic area.
